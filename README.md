# Budget-App
This program is designed to keep track of different budgets. It can create different budget categories, each with its own name, total funds, and ledger.
The user can deposit funds into a category, as well as withdraw funds from it and transfer funds between categories. They also have the option to display the percentage withdrawals from each of their budget categories.

This code was submitted as part of the 'Budget App' challenge in the Scientific Computing with Python course at freecodecamp.com.
